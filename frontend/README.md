# Fitness Market Frontend

This is a Next.js frontend application.

## Getting Started

First, install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

Then, build the application:

```bash
npm run build
```

Finally, start the production server:

```bash
npm run start
```

Or for development:

```bash
npm run dev
```

## Note

The `npm run start` command runs the production server which requires a build first. If you encounter the error `ENOENT: no such file or directory, open '.next/BUILD_ID'`, it means you need to run `npm run build` before `npm run start`.

For development purposes, use `npm run dev` instead which doesn't require a prior build.
